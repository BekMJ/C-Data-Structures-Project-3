# C-Data-Structures-Project-3Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has gained widespread attention in recent years. It
is a decentralized digital ledger that enables secure and transparent transactions without the need
for intermediaries such as banks or governments. The underlying technology is based on a
distributed network that is replicated across a network of computers/nodes. This makes
blockchain ideal for applications that require transparency, security, and trust in a decentralized
environment, such as cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and voting systems. The
potential uses of blockchain are vast and have the potential to revolutionize various industries by
creating a more secure, efficient, and transparent way of doing business.
In this project, we have three classes that you can see in the boilerplate code. The transaction
class will hold information about one transaction. An array of transaction class objects will be
present in the block class. This block class has a block number, the current number of
transactions and the maximum number of transactions that the block can hold. This maximum
number of transactions per block is given in the input.
The blockchain class has a list (linked list) of blocks along with the number of blocks. Object of
this blockchain class is what we declare in the main function.
For this project, you need not maintain the value of each person ID (fromID and toID). You will
just read the transaction from the input and insert into the data structure (blockchain). You need
not worry about if the person ID has enough funds to make the transaction or not.
